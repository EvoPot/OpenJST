## About OpenJST

OpenJST is Android(and soon Linux) app for Japanese Learning that is aiming to be fully Yomitan compatible.
This basically means that when you use cards that are made for Yomitan, they are going to look exactly the same as ones you made on pc.

Currently you can use the app to:

- Play videos
- Use subtitles??!
- Add yomitan dictionaries to the app?!
- Click on the subtitles to show their meanings????!!

OpenJST is currently in *alpha*.

The first beta build is planned to support:

- Handlebars
- More advanced text parsing
- Linux
- A mascot

The first release is planned to release when you can actually export cards to Anki, and is planned to release in about idk 3 months?? lol

If you are interested in using this app, please do make sure to report any problems you find with the app in the Issues section, or heck, you can even contribute.

Alright thats it I guess see you for the next readme update
